In this challenge, we were given a bash history and had to answer questions based on it

daniel is mentioned as a user quite clearly.

root wget linux-exploit-suggester.sh gives answer to what script was downloaded.

The last line shows an x.phtml file being removed. This also answers what filter is used it is a .phtml upload filter.

For last question, what misconfiguration was exploited, after a lot of detours. The user searches for files owned by root with permission 4000. 4 digit permissions imply special permissions. 
The first digit specifies if it is SUID, SGID, and sticky bit. 4 stands for SUID, so this is the misconfiguration the user exploited. 

DONE!
