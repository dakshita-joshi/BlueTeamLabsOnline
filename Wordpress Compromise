In this challenge, we are given access logs of a wordpress compromise incident. We are to analyse these logs and 
answer the questions. The tools used are goaccess.

goaccess access.log

An HTTP POST request to a login shell made with an adminlogin token is the answer to the first question wp-login.php?itsec-hb-token=adminlogin


The POST request that was made was to upload fr34k.php web shell file so that was the answer to question 5. 

fr34k.php was uploaded with simple-file-list so that would be the answer to what plugin was exploited to gain access.

For the version I looked it up on exploit database and it showed 4.2.2

To answer what CVE was the plugin vulnerable to, I googled contact form 7 and the CVE was CVE-2020-35489.

To answer what was the last request failure error code, I grepped and the last answer was 404.

Finally, after a lot of bruteforcing and scrolling through the logs, I found the answer to the tools the attacker used as sqlmap and wpscan. 

DONE!

(Im sorry, for some reason I cannot add screenshots here)
